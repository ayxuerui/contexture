## Before this skill: the store's tools stand in for a checkout

### In a checkout, use the store's own skill

If the working directory has a `contexture.yaml` at its root and a shell here runs `ctxr`, you are in a
checkout of the store, and this text is not for you. The `contexture:`-namespaced skills and commands, such as
`contexture:ctxr-capture` and `/contexture:capture`, are this plugin's, written for the store's server. The
un-namespaced `ctxr-<name>` skills in the store's skills folder are the store's own, written for a checkout.
In a checkout, invoke the un-namespaced `ctxr-<name>` skill of the same name and follow it, never the
`contexture:` one, and ignore the rest of this text. A `/contexture:` command typed in a checkout asks for that store
skill.

### Through the store's server

Otherwise you are working through this store's server, not in a checkout of it. Nothing runs a shell here, so no
`git`, `gh` or `ctxr` command runs as written. The skill below was written for an agent with a checkout:
follow it as written, and take each step it names through the tool these tables give.

### Commands

| Command | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| `ctxr session start` | `session_start` |
| `ctxr session list` | `session_list` |
| `ctxr session status` | `session_status` |
| `ctxr session submit` | `session_submit` |
| `ctxr session rebase` | `session_rebase` |
| `ctxr session discard` | `session_discard` |
| `ctxr shared-stores sync` | none |

A command marked none has no counterpart here: skip that step and say nothing about it. Each other tool takes its command's options as fields, each named for its option without the leading
dashes, and the session the command names as `session`: the session worktree's directory name, which
`session_start` returns and `session_list` lists. `session_start` takes the session's name as `label`.

Every other `ctxr` step runs through the `ctxr` tool when the command only reads, and through `ctxr_write`
when it writes. Pass the words after `ctxr` as `args`, one word per entry: a step that says to run
`ctxr lint` is the `ctxr` tool with `args` set to `["lint"]`. Name a session as `session` to run the command
in that session's working tree; `ctxr_write` always needs one. When a command reads a file you prepared,
pass the file's text as `input` and write `@input` in `args` where its path goes.

### Git steps

| Git step | Tool |
| --- | --- |
| `git mv` | `Move` |
| `git rm` | `Delete` |
| `git status` | `session_status` |
| `git diff` | `session_status` |
| `git log` | `session_status` |
| `git add` | `session_submit` |
| `git commit` | `session_submit` |
| `git push` | `session_submit` |
| `git branch -m` | `session_submit` |
| `gh pr create` | `session_submit` |
| `gh pr edit` | `session_submit` |
| `git fetch` | none |
| `git merge --ff-only` | none |
| `git rebase` | `session_rebase` |
| `git worktree add` | `session_start` |
| `git worktree list` | `session_list` |
| `git worktree remove` | `session_discard` |

Commits, pushes and pull requests happen only in `session_submit`. A step marked none is the server's own
work: it keeps the store's clone current, and `session_start` branches from the freshly fetched default
branch. Skip that step and say nothing about it.

### Paths

`session_start` returns the session's root, a path such as `<worktrees path><directory>/`. Every path the
skill names is relative to the store; inside a session it goes under that root, so the note `work/a.md` in
that session is `<worktrees path><directory>/work/a.md` for `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Move`, `Delete`,
`Grep` and `Glob`. A path without a session root reads the store as it was last approved, and a write to one
is refused. A change rests uncommitted in its session until `session_submit`.

### This store's settings

Where the skill uses one of this store's settings, it names the setting with a placeholder in angle
brackets, such as `<inbox path>`, `<log path>` or `<default branch>`. The connector's instructions give each
one's value under *This store*, by the same name, with the store's layers and its relation vocabulary. Use
that value wherever the placeholder appears, inside a path too: `<capture root>assets/` with a capture root
of `sources/` is `sources/assets/`. Other words in angle brackets, such as `<path>`, `<title>` or `<session>`, are
yours to fill as the step says. If the instructions are not in front of you, AGENTS.md states most of these
values; for one it does not state, ask the person rather than guess.

### More than one contexture connector

Someone in several stores has one connector per store, and each one's instructions name its own store and
values. Use the connector of the store the person names, with that store's values, and ask when it is unclear
which store they mean. A session, a path or a value from one store's connector never goes to another's.

### A step this connector does not offer

The skills update when contexture releases, and a store's server can run an older ctxr: *This store* gives
the version it runs. When a step names a tool the connector does not list, or the `ctxr` or `ctxr_write`
tool refuses a command the step names as one it does not run, tell the person that this store's server runs
an older ctxr, then skip that step or take the nearest step the connector does offer. Never improvise a
replacement for a step that writes.

### Sessions across conversations

The server keeps a session between conversations, but it cannot tell two conversations apart. At the
start of a conversation, call `session_list` and mention each open session: what it holds uncommitted,
and any requested changes on its pull request. Work in the session the person names, or start one.

Where the skill hands off to a skill this environment does not carry, such as landing or upgrading, or
asks you to work inside a store mounted under `shared/`, that step is not yours here: a person lands an approved change from the store's approval page.

# Connection finding

Traversal of links that already exist. To discover links a note SHOULD have, use `ctxr-connection-proposal`;
to synthesize an entity's current state from its sources, use `ctxr-rollup`.

1. Run `ctxr graph build` to refresh the wikilink graph from the store's current notes, then read the graph
   document it writes at `<graph document>` — hub notes by cluster, cross-cluster bridges,
   orphans — for the cluster context the point queries below do not summarize.
2. To find what a note connects to or from, run `ctxr graph query neighbors <path>` (add `--depth` for
   further hops, `--direction in|out|both`, `--type <relation>` to follow one configured relation).
3. To read a neighbourhood rather than enumerate one — every reachable note with its catalog gloss,
   hop distance, and why it was reached — run `ctxr context gather --seed <path> --hops <n>`. Use it
   when you need to judge which links matter; use the point queries below when you need the structure.
4. To find a path between two notes, run `ctxr graph query path <from> <to>`.
5. To find the most-referenced notes, run `ctxr graph query hubs`; to find unlinked ones,
   `ctxr graph query orphans`; `ctxr graph query clusters` and `ctxr graph query bridges` show the
   cluster structure and the notes that span it.
6. When the store mounts other stores under `shared/`, the graph carries their notes under `shared/<name>/`.
   Link from this store into a mount with a path link, such as `[[shared/<name>/<path>]]`.
   A filename link resolves only inside the store that holds the note. A note in a mount never resolves a link back into this store.
7. Report what the graph says — it enumerates structure and ranks nothing; judgment about which links
   matter is yours.
