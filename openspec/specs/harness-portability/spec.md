# harness-portability Specification

## Purpose

Keeps a contexture store operable from any agent harness — a coding agent with skill auto-discovery, one that reads only an entry document, a cron job, or a person at a terminal — by making the contexture-owned skills the portable surface: canonical content in the package, full copies in the store, delivered by `ctxr init` and refreshed by `ctxr update`, and indexed from the generated entry document. Those skills are decision procedures stated against whatever taxonomy, contexts, and relation vocabulary the store's `contexture.yaml` declares, never a shipped profile's or one deployment's names. The entry-document indexing mechanism merges here when `entry-doc-generation` archives.

## Requirements

### Requirement: `AGENTS.md` is the canonical entry document
Every context store SHALL carry an `AGENTS.md` file at its root that is the canonical, harness-agnostic index of the store's conventions and procedures. A harness-specific entry file (for example, one named for a particular agent product) SHALL contain nothing beyond an import of `AGENTS.md` plus that harness's own extras, and SHALL NOT duplicate canonical content.

#### Scenario: A harness-specific entry file only imports
- **WHEN** a store's `contexture.yaml` declares a harness-specific entry filename
- **THEN** `contexture doctor` fails if that file contains convention text not present in `AGENTS.md`, and passes when it contains only the import plus harness-specific extras

#### Scenario: Reading only `AGENTS.md` is sufficient
- **WHEN** an agent with no harness-specific context reads `AGENTS.md` at a store's root
- **THEN** it finds the root-resolution rule, the frontmatter schema pointer, the write-path rule, and an index of every store procedure, without needing to read any other file

### Requirement: Root resolution precedence
Any contexture command SHALL resolve the store root in this order: an explicit `--root` argument; the `CONTEXTURE_ROOT` environment variable; walking up from the current working directory looking for `contexture.yaml`. If none resolves, the command SHALL exit non-zero naming that no store root was found, and SHALL NOT guess a fallback location.

#### Scenario: Explicit argument overrides an inherited environment variable
- **WHEN** a command is invoked with `--root /path/a` while `CONTEXTURE_ROOT=/path/b` is set in the environment
- **THEN** the command operates against `/path/a`

#### Scenario: No root resolves
- **WHEN** a command is invoked with no `--root`, no `CONTEXTURE_ROOT`, and no `contexture.yaml` found by walking up from the current directory
- **THEN** the command exits non-zero with a message naming that no store root was found, and performs no store operation

### Requirement: Exactly one root environment variable and one root flag
The store root SHALL be addressable by exactly one environment variable and one command-line flag. No alias environment variable or flag name SHALL be introduced for the same purpose.

#### Scenario: No alias is recognized
- **WHEN** an operator sets an environment variable other than the one documented root variable, intending it to select the store root
- **THEN** contexture does not recognize it and falls through to the next resolution step

### Requirement: Procedures are portable markdown reached by path
Reusable store procedures SHALL be markdown files reachable by a documented path from `AGENTS.md`, readable and followable by any agent capable of reading files, independent of any harness's auto-discovery mechanism.

#### Scenario: A non-auto-discovering harness follows a procedure
- **WHEN** an agent harness with no automatic skill-discovery mechanism is given the path to a procedure listed in `AGENTS.md`
- **THEN** the agent can read and follow that procedure's file directly, with no harness-specific adaptation required

### Requirement: Executable portability test
The store SHALL provide a command that exercises core store operations — at minimum, a retrieval query, a derived-artifact build, and following one procedure via the `AGENTS.md` index — from an environment with no harness-specific state present, and SHALL exit non-zero naming the first failing operation if any operation fails.

#### Scenario: Portability test passes with no harness state
- **WHEN** the portability test command runs in a freshly created worktree with no harness-specific configuration or state directories present
- **THEN** it exits 0

#### Scenario: Portability test names the failure
- **WHEN** one of the exercised operations fails during the portability test
- **THEN** the command exits non-zero and its output names which specific operation failed

### Requirement: The shipped skills carry decision procedures
contexture SHALL ship, as contexture-owned skills delivered by init and update, procedures for: placement, ingest orchestration, connection finding, connection proposal, rollup, session lifecycle, session capture, derived artifacts, and organize audit. Each SHALL state its decision rules against the store's configured taxonomy, contexts, and relation vocabulary — never a shipped profile's layer names or any real context name — and SHALL name the command that verifies each step it asks for.

#### Scenario: Placement teaches the visibility-collision test
- **WHEN** a store is initialized
- **THEN** its placement skill states that two locations whose configured visibility defaults differ must not be merged, and that visibility may override location for content bridging contexts

#### Scenario: Placement's termination test follows the configured taxonomy
- **WHEN** a store's configured taxonomy declares a layer whose description implies an end state
- **THEN** the placement skill includes a test for whether a note has an end state; a store whose taxonomy declares no such layer receives no such test

#### Scenario: Connection proposal reads before it proposes
- **WHEN** an agent follows the connection-proposal skill
- **THEN** it is instructed to read each candidate note before proposing a link, to group proposals by the store's configured relation vocabulary (a single group when none is configured), and to confirm before writing

#### Scenario: Rollup refuses to create or to run thin
- **WHEN** an agent follows the rollup skill against a name that resolves to no note, or to a dated or infrastructure note, or to fewer sources than the stated minimum
- **THEN** the skill instructs it to stop and report rather than create the entity note, treat the non-entity as an entity, or write a thin rollup

#### Scenario: Session lifecycle gates every external side effect
- **WHEN** an agent follows the session-lifecycle skill
- **THEN** a push, a pull-request open, and a merge are each preceded by an explicit confirmation step, and the skill instructs a re-scan of git state before any plan and a verification of side effects before any retry

#### Scenario: Session capture proposes before it writes
- **WHEN** an agent follows the session-capture skill at the end of a session
- **THEN** it emits one proposal separating store notes from world facts from user facts, each item individually identified, and writes only approved items — to the identity files by path, never through a harness-specific memory mechanism

#### Scenario: Derived-artifact skill checks before it builds
- **WHEN** an agent follows the derived-artifacts skill
- **THEN** it runs the check form of a build before the build, sanity-checks the reported counts, and never edits inside a `contexture:` fenced region

#### Scenario: Update delivers the expanded skill set to an existing store
- **WHEN** a store initialized before this change runs the update command
- **THEN** every owned skill above is present at the configured procedures path with the managed header, and a second update reports nothing changed

### Requirement: Owned skills read the vocabulary and the graph document from configuration
The connection-proposal skill SHALL group proposals by the relation vocabulary declared in configuration and fall back to a single group when it is empty; the connection-finding and ingest-orchestration skills SHALL direct the agent to the graph document at its configured path for cluster context; and the generated entry document's retrieval section SHALL name that path. No skill SHALL hardcode a relation name.

#### Scenario: Vocabulary flows into the proposal skill
- **WHEN** a store's configuration declares the relation names `supports` and `contradicts`
- **THEN** the rendered connection-proposal skill lists those two groups and no other relation name

#### Scenario: Empty vocabulary yields one group
- **WHEN** a store declares no relation vocabulary
- **THEN** the rendered skill instructs a single group and names no relation
